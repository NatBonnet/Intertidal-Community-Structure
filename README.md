# Community Structure and Barnacle Settlement on Coil Oil Point Reserve is Linked to Intertidal Zone and Substrate Type
Barnacle settlement in a marine intertidal zone is informative of the population dynamics and abiotic forces contributing to recrutiment patterns. In our study we sought to understand the community structure between upper and lower intertidal zones on a Santa Barbara intertidal ecosystem, and the factors that determine barnacle settlement. We conducted a field study using quadrats to estimate the percent cover of organisms and substrate types, and used a factorial design experiment to test barnacle settlement on smooth and rough substrate between intertidal zones. Invertebrate abundance was highest in the low tide zone, and barnacle recruitment was significantly higher on rough substrate in the lower intertidal zone. Our results contribute to our understanding of dirtribution patterns by broadcast spawning organisms in environments with various types of settlement surface and intertidal conditions. This information will be critical to predicting habitable species ranges as sea levels rise and temperate environments experience warming effects.
